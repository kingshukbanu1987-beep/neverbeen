        'Before they married, Lotte and Bram drew a tiny blue train on the back of their wedding invitation. It marked the honeymoon they imagined: Lucerne by rail, a slow afternoon beside Lake Brienz, and no alarm set for the next morning.',
        'Then work kept asking for one more thing. A teammate was away; a launch slipped; urgent shifts landed on the same dates. Their leave requests moved from spring to autumn, then off the calendar. They could afford the idea. What they could not find was a clear week when both of them could step away without letting someone down.',
        'On their anniversary, they sent NeverBeen portraits they already owned and asked to see the version of the story where the train did leave. The photographs here are imagined—not evidence of a trip. They gave the couple a picture to place beside the invitation, and a way to keep the promise visible until life makes room.',
      ],

        'They chose NeverBeen for a personal, imagined keepsake while work pressure kept shifting their plans—not to pretend the honeymoon had happened, but to honour a promise they still hope to keep.',

        'Ananya grew up in a middle-class family in Pune, collecting Paris in library books, films and the travel pages she saved for later. She pictured a day on her own terms: a walk beside the Seine, a map open at the Louvre, coffee at a little pavement table.',
        'The reason she stayed home was never one simple answer. Some years money mattered; in others, family responsibilities needed her, work leave would not line up, or the thought of travelling solo felt bigger than the time she had to prepare. Each reason was real. Paris kept becoming “maybe next year”—not because she did not care enough, but because life was already asking a lot of her.',
        'For her birthday, she asked NeverBeen to imagine a small set of portraits in the city she still hopes to explore. They are not proof that she has been to Paris. They let her see herself inside a dream that belongs to her, while the actual journey remains out of reach for now.',
      ],
      reason:
